* Requirements

  CliqueClique itself requires only *PostgreSQL*. Version *8.3.7* is
  known to work. *pyPgSQL* is used for interfacing with PostgreSQL.

  The Ubuntu package for pyPgSQL is called python-pgsql. The package
  supports PostgreSQL 8, even though the package description does not
  specify that.

  The test environment uses *[[https://projects.freecode.no/projects/show/webwidgets][Redback Webwidgets]]*, with the
  Graphviz-widget, which currently is only available in the
  bleeding-edge development version. The Graphviz-widget
  requires *pydot*.

  Webwidgets require *Python 2.5*. Python 2.4 or 2.6 are currently not
  supported.

  Webwidgets require *[[http://www.webwareforpython.org/][Webware]]*. Version *1.0.2* is known to work.

* Installation
** CliqueClique and PostgreSQL

  Place CliqueClique anywhere you like. Make sure pyPgSQL is
  installed.

  Make sure the PostgreSQL user and database specified in Config.py
  exists.

  When running webware (by running the WebKit/AppServer script), make
  sure your PYTHONPATH includes the directory that contains your
  CliqueClique directory.

** Webwidgets

  Get Webwidgets and put it in your site-packages directory, which is
  likely to be /usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages . Make sure pydot is
  installed.

** Webware

  Get Webware and put it anywhere you like. Run its install.py-script
  with Python 2.5.

  Edit the file WebKit/Configs/Application.config to include the line:

    Contexts['cliqueclique'] = '/YOUR/PATH/TO/CliqueClique/Test/Webwidgets/Webware'

  And change the ExtraPathInfo line to:

    ExtraPathInfo = True

  You will probably want to edit WebKit/AppServer, and change the
  PYTHON line to:

    PYTHON=python2.5

  If you want your Webware server to listen for connections other than
  from localhost edit the WebKit/Configs/AppServer.config
  appropriately.
