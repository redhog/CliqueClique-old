* IDs and PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL can compare multiple values in an aggregate function using
arrays. E.g. "select col12[1], col12[2] from (select min(array[col1,
col2]) as col12 from foo) as bar;" will select the row with the lowest
col1 value, and among those rows, if there are more than one with the
same value, the one with the lowest col2 value. However, this only
works if all columns have compatible types, e.g. integer and numeric
(not integer and varchar).

As center_distance is integer, center_node needs to be that too (or a
compatible type, like numeric).

It might be a good idea generally to store IDs (node_id:s,
message_id:s) as numeric, not hexadecimal varchar. What about
transmission?
